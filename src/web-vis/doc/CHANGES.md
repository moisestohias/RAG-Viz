# Changelog

## 2025-12-12
- **Added anchor point (set point as center) feature**: Users can now click any point to make it the rotation center, with visual highlighting and double‑click reset. Implemented translate‑rotate‑project pattern, global anchor state, click handler, and UI feedback.
- Updated zoom handling to keep focus under cursor and extended zoom range to 300.
- Fixed CTRL+drag behavior by globally tracking the CTRL key and customizing the drag filter.
- Adjusted UI hints to reflect new controls (anchor, reset).
